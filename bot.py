# GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
# Version 3, 29 June 2007

# Copyright Â© 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

# Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

# The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

# The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. 
# By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program
# to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; 
# it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

# When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom 
# to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change 
# the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

# To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain 
# responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

# For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you 
# received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

# Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you 
# legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

# For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' 
# and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously 
# to authors of previous versions.

# Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer 
# can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of 
# such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have 
# designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we 
# stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

# Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of 
# software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program 
# could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

# Giving the now streaming role when someone in the server streams a TICO game. Could be a role
# to opt in to this feature, so I dont have to be checking everyone in the world
#
# Command that gives all the positions people have in all 3 games and CE
